Description: The main purpose of this R package is to provide functions used 
    to accurately fit sample ages with an imbalanced distribution with DNA 
    methylation data, using an ensemble framework integrating bootstrapping 
	and synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) methods. It also 
	contains other functions to do data visualization, DNA methylation feature 
	conversion and annotation, etc.
